# FGID kinship software

The FGID kinship software is an application specifically designed for direct use on Windows systems, intended to function in conjunction with the FGID Microhaplotype kit for kinship analysis. This software enables users to input the genotyping data for MH loci from multiple samples simultaneously, thereby facilitating efficient kinship analysis. It features a user-friendly interface and provides accurate kinship results, aiming to deliver efficient and convenient services to users with relevant needs.

## features

- High Accuracy: The FGID kinship software, when used in conjunction with the FGID Microhaplotype Kit, demonstrates superior accuracy compared to traditional CE-STR analysis results, especially for more distant relationships such as half-siblings and first cousins.
- Support for Multiple Application Scenarios: In addition to kinship analysis, the software supports a variety of forensic and genetic applications, including individual identification, duos testing, trios testing, mitochondrial DNA analysis, and Y-chromosome analysis, addressing a wide range of needs from familial relationships to individual identity verification.
- Convenience: Once downloaded, the software can be used immediately, with minimal requirements for input file formats.
- Efficiency: The software can efficiently process datasets with dimensions of 10,000 by 10,000 samples and analyze multiple MH loci simultaneously. This significantly enhances the capability to handle large-scale datasets.
