# README

This is a script for simulating family relationships (Fig1) based on a frequency file (excluding complex situations such as mutations). 

- Individuals in the figure without parental information are referred to as **founders**, and their genotypes are determined based on the frequency file. 

- For individuals with parental information, their genotypes are determined by randomly selecting one allele from each of the father's and mother's two alleles.
